# module2-solution
This is the solution for courera fullstack-course4-assigment2.
Was able to show in three different view: desktop view, tablet view, and mobile view.
## In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections takes up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. 
## In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
## In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row.
